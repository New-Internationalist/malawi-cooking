              <p>In Malawi, the ‘National Cookstove Steering Committee’, a coordinating body for officials and NGOs working on the issue, hopes for 2 million homes to adopt cleaner and efficient stoves and fuels by 2020. </p>

<p>Nearly one in 10 deaths in Malawi is attributed to cooking fumes; and household air pollution from solid fuels is the leading risk factor for the disease burden in the country. A simple household appliance has been designed to save lives and the environment.
Yet not everyone has caught fire for the improved household appliance and uptake has been slow. Is the cookstove a poor solution for the poor?
Explore our interactive map that looks at the experiences of cookstove users, reasons for slow uptake and potential solutions in Malawi.
