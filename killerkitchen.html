              <h2>The killer in the kitchen</h2>
              <p>Globally, cooking smoke causes  45 times the number of the global annual deaths from natural disasters, and more than twice the number of people dying of HIV/AIDS (1.5 million in 2013).</p>
              <p>Reliance on solid fuels is one of the 10 most important threats to public health globally. It might as well be the most unreported of the world’s big problems. A shift towards cleaner and more efficient modern fuels and cookstoves, could help eliminate this health risk.</p> 
              <p>According to the World Health Organization, more than half of premature deaths among children under the age of five are due to pneumonia caused by breathing this smoke, and there is evidence of a link with low birth weight. On average, babies exposed to household air pollution in the womb are born 90 grams lighter at birth than babies that have not been exposed to household air pollution.</p>
              <p>Open cooking fires are also a health and safety risk to children playing around the fire. In Malawi, many children and women suffer with burn injuries from cooking over open fires: they might trap over a log knocking over a pot with boiling water, or fall into the flames.</p> 
              <p>More serious burns require immediate emergency medical care to prevent complications and death. With a lack of surgical facilities, medicines and even doctors and nurses – rural hospitals can’t meet the demand. Patients are referred to Kamuzu Central Hospital in the capital, Lilongwe, where they are treated by a small group of nurses, led by head nurse Chrissy Nyirenda.</p>
              <p>Her ward mainly treats women and children ‘because they spend more time in the kitchen’, she says. Most children that come through her ward were burned with hot liquid; most adults suffer from epilepsy – open fire poses a significant risk to them. She also treats men, who mainly come in with burns obtained at the workplace, but ‘there are many less of them’.</p>
