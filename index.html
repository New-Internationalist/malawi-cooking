              <h2>Smoke</h2>
              <p>Smoke is the silent killer in the kitchen: every 8 seconds, a person dies of cooking fumes.</p>
              <p>Every year, indoor pollution claims the lives of over 4.3 million people  all over the world –   more than malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined.</p>
              <p>Almost half of the world population uses firewood, charcoal or dung to cook. Women and children risk contracting deadly lung and heart diseases, as they breathe in thick smoke for hours while preparing meals. ‘Unclean’ cooking causes a global health crisis – with huge environmental consequences.</p>
              <p>Malawi is one of the 20 most affected countries on the world – can a solution be found for its burning problem?</p>

              <h2>Balancing the burden</h2>
              <p>Charity Gogoda, 21, and Merida and Rhoda, her teenage girlfriends,  are on their way back from a three-hour trek into the forest on the slopes of Mount Mulanje. Charity points to the 20kg bundles of firewood perched on each of their heads. ‘It’s heavy’, she says.</p>
              <p>Every three days they make the journey from their village, Mulema – a little hamlet surrounded by tea plantations in the south of Malawi – to collect wood. ‘We need it for cooking nsima,’ the country’s staple maize porridge.</p>
              <p>In Malawi, 98 per cent of the population relies on biomass woodfuels to cook – mostly charcoal in the cities and firewood in rural areas. But together with health risks, using woodfuels imposes a massive burden on women and on the environment.</p>
              <p>Deforestation and the related degradation of ecosystems threaten food security. In 2016, Malawi’s President Peter Mutharika declared a state of national emergency over food shortages caused by severe drought. In February last year the price of maize had already increased by 60 per cent.</p>

              <h2>Cooking kills</h2>
              <p>Women and children are the most exposed to the health risks of cooking fumes – as they spend the longest time in kitchens and around fires. In Malawi, nearly one in 10 deaths are attributed to cooking fumes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called exposure to smoke produced by burning biomass fuels  a major public health risk. </p>
              <p>In Malawi’s badly ventilated homes, toxic smoke can carry more than 100 times the acceptable level of fine soot particles, which penetrate deep into the lungs – destroying cells beyond repair. Just one hour indoors  has been likened to smoking 400 cigarettes.</p>
              <p>Cooking over open fires can cause respiratory infections, lung cancer, heart disease and blindness as well as short term suffering such as coughing, burning eyes, chest pain and headaches.</p>
              <p>Tina Chirwa, from Pitala village in Nkhata-Bay district, is having to constantly duck in and out of the kitchen. ‘When there is too much smoke I have to go for air and then come back,’ she says. Her sister Vanessa adds: ‘the smoke is giving me headaches and I get tears in my eyes while cooking. It makes me cough.’</p>

              <p>A group of women of Pitala say that extension workers from the Ministry of Health have told them that cigarettes are bad for them, but did not mention the ill effects of cooking smoke. Only a fraction (0.4 per cent) of Malawian women smoke cigarettes, but all of them have to prepare meals.</p>
              <p>Playing children and people with epilepsy are also heavily exposed to the risks of open fires. Boniface, a 16-year-old suffering from epilepsy, fell in the fire when his mother was boiling water.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h2>The clean cooking solution</h2>
              <p>Improved cookstoves have been identified by the ‘Global Alliance for Clean Stoves’ as a key tool in the fight against smoke exposure, deforestation, climate change and as an enabler for women empowerment. So-called improved or ‘cleaner’ cookstoves have more energy efficient fuel combustion systems, and also produce less smoke.</p>
              <p>In Malawi, the affiliated ‘National Cookstove Steering Committee’ hopes for two million homes to adopt clean and efficient stoves and fuels by 2020. To this day, a range of NGOs and businesses have provided half a million households with cookstoves.</p>
              <p>Women who cook on improved cookstoves report that they save fuel and time. Florence Togama from Mulumbe village in the South of Malawi says, ‘I don’t have to walk so long to collect firewood.’ Flora Kandodo from Nessa village agrees and adds that ‘it also doesn’t smoke so much.’</p>
              <p>But even if NGOs and donors are convinced of the modified stoves, not all researchers are sold on their positive health effects. Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine, Kevin Mortimer, for example, found that the modified cook stove he tested in Malawi did not necessarily prevent pneumonia.</p>
              <p>Others are even more critical about the ‘solution for all’. Uptake of the stoves, after almost 30 years of NGO presence, is still low.  ‘Perhaps we just need better stoves’, says Cornwell Chisale, Energy Officer at the Alternative and Renewable Section of the Department of Energy. ‘These clay things are just too indigenous – they just don’t pass the test of the sophisticated society of today.’</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h2>Stove economics</h2>
              <p>Local stoves may not yet be the consensus solution, but they do provide a source of income. Women groups make some money by manufacturing and selling stoves. Astina from Nessa village relates the successes of her Aleva production group: ‘We sold almost 220 stoves since 2011. Almost everyone in this village has a stove now.’</p>
              <p>That too poses challenges, though. Heather Campbell, Country Director for United Purpose, a Britain-based charity, is aware of the complications of a rural economy.</p>
              <p>‘There comes a time when the market reaches its saturation point – when these women have sold stoves to everyone in their catchment area,’ she says. Small production groups find their local markets saturate quickly, with no solid distribution plan available. To overcome this, the charity tried to connect rural groups with urban consumers by encouraging the women to sell their stoves at gas stations.</p>
              <p>Yet after 30 years of NGO work – the cookstove market is only really profitable for a lucky few – those who have managed to strike a deal with charities and development agencies able to guarantee regular purchase of products.</p>

              <h2>Malawi&#8217;s black gold</h2>
              <p>If the cookstove business is slumping, another business, meanwhile, is booming: charcoal. Malawi’s charcoal trade is currently the country’s third largest industry, after tobacco and tea. Charcoal is the choice cooking fuel of the urban poor, and its production the main driver of deforestation.</p> 
              <p>As a result, Malawi’s forest reserves are dwindling: An estimated 50,000 hectares are lost every year. Drastic measures need to be taken to turn the tide: ‘If we don’t act now, in five years the forests will be gone’ says Mr. Kabichi, Assistant Plantation Manager at Dzalanyama Forest Reserve.</p>
