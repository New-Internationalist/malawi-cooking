              <h2>Black gold in Malawi</h2>
              <p>Almost daily large trucks loaded with big bags of illegal charcoal are confiscated on the road from Dzalanyama forest to Lilongwe. The Forestry Department, authorized under the 1997 National Forestry Act to crack down on illegal charcoal, is ever more despairing.</p>
              <p>‘We are losing so much forest’, says Mr Kabichi, Assistant Plantation Manager of Dzalanyama forest reserve, part of the Department of Forestry. Illegal charcoal production is a major factor driving the country’s 2,8 per cent annual deforestation rate – leaving the small south-eastern African country vulnerable to environmental degradation and climate change.</p>

              <p>Mr Aubrey Palani, Plantation Manager at Katate Plantation close to Dzalanyama, warns that ‘in five years, there could be no more trees left’, referring to the fast pace of ongoing deforestation in Malawi</p> 
              <p>Since 2016, the Department of Forestry partners with the Malawi Defence Forces (MDF) – deployed in the most important forest reserves in the country to shut down illegal charcoal production. It is an almost impossible task for the army – they have to protect a forest that spans over almost 1,000 square km – with around 30 soldiers.</p>

              <h3 style="color:#fff">Fighting poverty or criminality?</h3>
              <p>In one of the poorest countries in the world, people ‘see the forest as their primary source of income. So they just go and steal – it is a free resource to them’ explains Stella Gama, Assistant Director at the Department of Forestry. Mr Kabichi agrees: ‘the problem is that charcoal burning is creating a sort of business.’</p>
              <p>Cities like Mzuzu, Blantyre and Lilongwe depend on the forest for their energy needs, and are increasing demand. In urban areas over 60 per cent of the population now cooks on charcoal – the national grid is not providing reliable electricity, ethanol and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) are too expensive, and firewood is perceived as ‘dirty’ and a step down on the energy ladder.</p>
              <p>In the cities, charcoal means money. Rose John, a charcoal seller at the Ngoma charcoal market in Lilongwe tells her story: ‘I was selling soda before, but I was not making good profits so I ventured into this business. I started seeing that people would come and buy large quantities especially when there is no electricity – then people buy a lot.’</p>
              <p>Harold Nuyndo, chairman of an illegal charcoal market in Lilongwe, clarifies why he opted to get involved in the profitable yet illegal business: ‘When I graduated from school – there was no job available’. Rose John, one of his colleagues agrees: ‘it is because we are poor.’</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>A governance issue?</h3>
              <p>Around 60 per cent of all charcoal comes from national parks and forest reserves. ‘No one will chop down a tree that belongs to themselves’, says  District Forestry Officer Teresa Mvula.</p>
              <p>But with the change of government – from a one-party state to a democracy – the situation got worse. According to Kabichi, in the past ‘people feared even to pass by the forest’.</p>
              <p>An army commander deployed in Dzalanyama forest shows us the scale of the illegal networks that are operating now. ‘Those are organised businessmen, and they use the forest as their source of income. They are acting like they are the government themselves. It is very profitable for them because forest resources are expensive.’</p>
              <h3>The players of the game</h3>
              <p>Illegal charcoal is produced mostly in the forest – usually at night. Immediately after felling the tree, the wet wood is carbonised in traditional kilns made of earth. A highly inefficient process: ‘It takes 6-9 kg of wood to get 1 kg of charcoal,’ illustrates Isaac Salima, the director of Phukaphuka, a small sustainable cook stove production company.</p> 
              <p>Only about 15 per cent of the felled tree is finally transformed into charcoal. Illegal charcoal producers travel within the forest reserves – hoping to leave no trace for the police or army.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Bags on the rack</h3>
              <p>From the forest, charcoal producers move to villages where they strike a deal with transporters who can carry the bags to illegal markets in urban centres - or sell their goods on the road to the big cities of Blantyre and Lilongwe.</p>
              <p>Carrying a load of 150 kilos of charcoal on his bicycle, transporter Handle Marino, for example, pedals to reach Malawi’s capital Lilongwe early morning to meet his clients. On the road from his village to the city, he runs the risk of getting caught by police, arrested and abused and worst case scenario – his load confiscated. After selling his load to his buyer, Handle makes his way back to his village with a profit of 3000 Kwacha in pocket [US $4.14].</p>
              <p>On illegal charcoal markets wholesale sellers like Rose sell their goods to city women or others that repackage the charcoal in smaller bags. She makes around 2500 Kwacha [around US $3,45] profit – but not without risk: ‘the police make a lot of problems.’</p>
              <h3>Will the future sort itself?</h3>
              <p>Harold Nyundo, Vice-chairman of the Mgona community charcoal market in Lilongwe is one of the many that squeeze a living out of the black gold. He and his colleague Steven have just come back from the police station where two of his colleagues were held for selling illegal charcoal.</p>
              <p>He fails to see the seriousness of their colleague’s crime. ‘In South Africa, they have gold and they are also destroying the environment,’ he says. ‘Here, we don’t have gold – we have the forest. In the future? We will see how the future will sort itself.’</p>
              <p>‘Charcoal is here to stay’, agrees Ramzy Kanaan, Chief of Party of PERFORM, an initiative working on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). That’s why the only option is to promote ‘the efficiency, consumption and management of resources’ in Malawi.</p>
              <p>As for Mr Kabichi, the plantation manager at Dzalanyama forest, he also believes the answer can be efficient forest management: ‘we encourage people to plant more trees’. The way forward, according to him is by getting the community behind the policies through intensive community engagement and education.</p>
