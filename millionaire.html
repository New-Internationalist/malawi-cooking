              <h2>Cookstove millionaire</h2>
              <p>At the foot of Mulanje Mountain, a statue of Africa’s Big Five (lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and rhino) towers in front of the ‘Hapuwani Village Lodge’, a luxurious resort in the south of Malawi. The hotel was built by Ken Chilewe, Mulanje’s very own ‘cookstove millionaire’.</p>
              <p>Cookstoves paid for Ken’s luxury village. He is the only entrepreneur in Malawi to have made millions with this household appliance. Selling ‘institutional’ cookstoves to international donors like UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the international charity Mary’s Meals made him what he calls ‘big bucks’. Ken started with one improved cookstove and now sells in bulk to UN agencies in Mozambique, Zambia and Uganda. His ‘institutional’ stoves can be used to prepare food for big groups - schools, weddings, funerals.</p>
              <p>He remembers well how his business started. Ken benefitted from a training scheme organised by the German Society for International Co-operation (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ) with 24 other young entrepreneurs. They were taught how to make cleaner cookstoves that use less firewood.</p>
              <p>Initially, his friends scoffed at him. ‘Who wants to buy this? Why are you involved in women’s business’? But Ken was the only trainee to be persistent enough to set up a business after the training. And today he is the sole ruler of a what looks like Malawi’s cookstove monopoly. His friends had already stopped laughing when Ken sold his first 400 stoves to WFP.</p>

              <p>He has advice for other aspiring business women and men ‘There is big money in this,’ he says. ‘Go to the donors.’</p>
              <p>Ken sells his stoves for around 10 to 220 Pounds depending on the size of pot the stove can hold. The biggest stove his company produces can hold up to 200 litres. He makesaround 15 per cent profit on each stove.</p>
              <p>Why didn’t copycats replicate his model? ‘They cannot afford the big upfront instalment,’ Ken says. ‘The market is there, but people can’t afford it’. And what does the future of the cookstove business look like in Malawi? ‘If NGOs and UN agencies leave, that will be the end.’.He shrugs. ‘That would be so bad for me’. Until then, the business is his.</p>
              <p><img src="images/kenstove-0.jpg" alt="Ken's institutional stoves" style="float:left;margin-right:1em" />Ken Chilewe sells ‘institutional stoves’: stoves that can hold large pans –  with liquid up to 200 litre.

              <p ><img src="images/kenstove-1.jpg" alt="Ken's rocket stove" style="float:right; margin-left:1em" />Ken Chilewe (right) is the most successful man in Mulanje – his business ‘Ken Steel Engineering’ makes millions of dollars selling cookstoves.
